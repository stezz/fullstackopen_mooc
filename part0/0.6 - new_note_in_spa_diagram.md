# Exercise 0.6: Diagram - adding new note in single page application case
In this case the sequence diagram is much simpler as the processing and re-rendering of the new note happens in browser, before the new note gets sent to the server. There are no redirects that make the browser make more calls to the server.

```mermaid

    participant browser
    participant server

    Note right of browser: The JS of the SPA page creates a new note, 
    Note right of browser: adds it to the notes list,
    Note right of browser: and rerenders the note list on the page.
    Note right of browser: Only now it sends the note to the server.

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: 201 (Created)
    deactivate server

    Note left of server: The server does not instruct the browser to reload the page in the SPA case.

    Note left of server: (The 201 response indicates that the request was successful and a new resource (the note) has been created)
